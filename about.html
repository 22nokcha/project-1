            <h2 class="about-title">Their Friendship</h2>
            <p>
                Although the best of pals in the present, their friendship began with a rocky start.
                Snoopy and Woodstock had their first encounter on April 4, 1967 when Woodstock literally dropped into
                Snoopy's life, landing on his stomach and falling asleep after a long flight.
                From then on, Woodstock would make frequent returns, but often leaving Snoopy annoyed and confused with
                his unpredictable behavior (flying upside down, crashing into Snoopy's house, building nests on Snoopy's
                stomach, etc).
                To make it even harder for them to connect, Woodstock spoke in an unintelligible manner.
                However, over time, Snoopy began to warm up to Woodstock, finding him rather interesting and nice to
                have around.
                Woodstock also started feeling more comfortable to hang around Snoopy for longer and tell him about
                things going on in his life.
                With a newly found mutual understanding for eachother, their relationship would soon evolve into the
                most precious and iconic friendship in <i>Peanuts</i> history.
